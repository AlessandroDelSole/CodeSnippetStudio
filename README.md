# Code Snippet Studio 2016

Code Snippet Studio is an application that makes it easy to create, edit, package, and share IntelliSense code snippets for Visual Studio 2015.

With Code Snippet Studio, you have a fully-functional code editor where you can write or paste your snippets and supply the information that is required by the Code Snippet Schema Reference. Studio will generate the proper .snippet files for you. You will then be able to package a number of code snippets into a Visual Studio extension by building .vsix packages that you can share with other developers and that you can even publish to the Visual Studio Gallery! Additional tools are available to work with both .vsix and .vsi installers.

Code Snippet Studio is available both as a stand-alone WPF application and as an integrated tool window for Visual Studio 2015.

Code Snippet Studio has been built using controls from [Syncfusion's Essential Studio for WPF (Community license)](https://www.syncfusion.com/products/communitylicense) and is built upon the [DelSole.VSIX library](https://github.com/AlessandroDelSole/delsolevsix).
